This zip contains modules for:
1. Audio-based headshot detection using MFCC + cosine similarity.
2. Visual flash detection for red/pink headshot indicators around the crosshair.

To use:
- Hook these detectors into your clip scoring pipeline.
- Use a scoring heuristic that boosts clips with visual OR audio headshot cues.
- Extend audio learning with new sample headshots to refine detection.
